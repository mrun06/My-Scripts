#Create a safe password automatically generated based on the user settings
#Requirements - User will input the password generator parameters (how many characters,
# length of the password, would it include special characters or not, etc)
# - You must avoid characters that could look similar (lower case "L" and number "1" for example
# think of other confusing characters)
# - You should get from the user, how many password should be prompt into the screen.
